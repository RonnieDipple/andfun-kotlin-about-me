    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Ronnie.
        \n\nI love my Wife and Dog
        \n\nI am from the UK
        \n\nIf you are ever in trouble remember this quote:
        \n\nJust remember what ol Jack Burton does when the earth
        \n\nquakes, and the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven
        \n\nshake. Yeah, Jack Burton just looks that big ol storm right square in the eye
        \n\nand he says, Give me your best shot, pal. I can take it.
        \n\nAlso never for get this
        \n\nWhen some wild-eyed, eight-foot-tall maniac grabs your neck, taps the back of your
        \n\nfavorite head up against the barroom wall, looks you crooked in the eye, and asks you if you paid your
        \n\ndues; you just stare that big sucker right back in the eye, and you remember what ol Jack Burton
        \n\nalways says at a time like that: Have you paid your dues, Jack? Yes sir, the check is in the mail.
